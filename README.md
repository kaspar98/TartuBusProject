Project M7: TARTU-BUS-ANALYSIS

Project for "Introduction to Data Science" course (2019).

Tartu launched new inner city bus routes in 01.07.2019 [1]. Our project analyses whether the new timetables need changing or not.

Dataset 1 (56.4 MB): data from 01.09.2019-18.10.2019 with all the bus stops where the bus departed over 3 min later than supposed to. Data includes 260K rows with route numbers, dates, stop names, departure time deviations, pseudonymised bus driver names (private dataset from Tartu City Government)

Dataset 2 (24.3 MB): data from 01.09.2019-18.10.2019 with all the bus stops where the bus departed over 10 sec earlier than supposed to. Similar to dataset 1, but with 125K rows (private dataset from Tartu City Government)

Goal 1: Our main goal is to figure out do any of the new bus route timetables need changing because buses constantly arrive too early/late to some stops (find problematic bus stops).

Goal 2:  Find any interesting trends or patterns from the data that could have some practical use.
